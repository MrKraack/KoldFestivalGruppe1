# kold-festival-gruppe1
This is a project for Musik Kolding, where we had to develop a new website, for their festival "Kold Festival".

## Technologi
For this project, we have used Vue js as our framework, and Sanity.IO to handle the database

### Vue JS
Link: https://vuejs.org/
We have used Vue JS for our project, because it's a framework that's focused on working with components, and that makes
it easier to maintain and easier to work as a group

### Sanity.IO
Link: https://www.sanity.io/
For the database, we have chosen to use Sanity.IO, because it's very user friendly, and even non programmers, can with 
ease make new entries.
It's also easy for programmers to use, since we can just make a query request using GraphQL to Sanity.IO, and have the
option to sort through the data using GrapQL. That way, we don't have to get the entire database, but only the data we
need right now

### Project setup
```
When you first download this project, you should run the command "npm install", to install all the dependencies our
project uses
```

### Compiles and hot-reloads for development
```
after using "npm install", you can now run the command "npm run serve" to host a local version of the website
```
